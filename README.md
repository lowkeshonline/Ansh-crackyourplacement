# Ansh-crackyourplacement
This repository consists of the notes of my DSA practice for placements

Welcome to Ansh-CrackYourPlacement! ðŸš€
This repository is my personal journey of solving DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problems in preparation for placement interviews and coding challenges.

Iâ€™ll be committing every problem I solve here â€” covering a variety of topics from arrays to dynamic programming, easy to hard problems, and everything in between.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repo
	â€¢	ðŸ“Œ To track my progress as I practice DSA daily.
	â€¢	ðŸ§  To master problem-solving skills needed for technical interviews.
	â€¢	ðŸ“‚ To maintain an organized archive of solutions that I can revisit anytime.

 ## ðŸŒŸ Goals
	â€¢	Finish the entire DSA sheet before placements.
	â€¢	Consistently solve at least X problems per day (Iâ€™ll update the exact number in progress logs).
	â€¢	Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.
